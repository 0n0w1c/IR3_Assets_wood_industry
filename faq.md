#### About the License and Technical Modifications

Under the *Creative Commons license (Section 2(a)(4))*, the clause “Media and formats; technical modifications allowed” lets users make technical changes needed to use the work across different platforms or software versions. In this case, that means you are allowed to update or modify files such as info.json so the mod works with newer versions of Factorio. These updates are technical adjustments for compatibility, not creative edits to the content itself. Because of this, making such changes does not create an Adapted Material under the license — it’s still the same licensed work, just updated to function properly.

#### Is this mod a derivative work of Industrial Revolution 3 (IR3)?

No. A derivative work involves creative transformation—changing, remixing, or building upon another author’s expression. This mod doesn’t do that; it only references IR3’s existing assets so Factorio will display them. It does not alter or redistribute IR3’s artwork, its use of those assets is purely technical and functional. Under Creative Commons principles, such technical integrations do not create Adapted Material or derivative works.

#### What is the intent of the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license?

The license is meant to let people use and share the work freely, while still crediting the original creator and keeping the same freedoms for others. It ensures that others can build on or reuse the work responsibly — without claiming ownership of it, removing attribution, or restricting access to it later. In short, it’s about sharing, collaboration, and preserving openness, not about limiting legitimate, non-creative technical use.

#### Respect for the Original Work

This mod respects the rights of the Industrial Revolution 3 creator **Deadlock989**. There is no redistribution of the IR3 assets — it simply references them via the API, and requires players to have the original IR3 asset packs installed. All credit remains with **Deadlock989**. The license terms are followed exactly as intended. This mod exists purely to maintain compatibility and to persist the visual beauty within Factorio, not to exploit the original work.
